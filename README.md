# Spotify Top Songs Analysis (2010-2019)

This project analyzes the *Top Spotify Songs from 2010 to 2019* dataset to explore trends in audio features and predict song popularity using various regression models.

The dataset includes information such as song title, artist, year, and multiple audio attributes like danceability, energy, loudness, and more. The goal is to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis, build and compare linear, polynomial, and ridge regression models to predict song popularity, and tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and can be found here:
