# Housing Prices Analysis

This project analyzes the **Housing Prices Dataset** from Kaggle to explore the relationships between housing features and sale price, and to build predictive models that estimate home prices based on various attributes.

The dataset includes variables such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, stories, parking availability, and more. The goal is to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model the data using linear, polynomial, and ridge regression techniques, and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning. Generative AI tools were used throughout the project to support analysis, code generation, and insight documentation.
